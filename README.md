# typo-squatting

First install go and the safe browsing google library from
https://github.com/google/safebrowsing after installing GOLANG
version 1.9. This does not work properly with the rest of the versions
I checked.

Things yet to be implements:
1. sanitize html: see sanitizer.js
2. typo squat wrapper: there are some errors please rectify them.
3. fill in the missing parts of main.js
4. advert links: see advertLinks.js
